1. For my problem, I am trying to read the txt file line by line.
2. In this case, readFile won't work. But read stream will work. 

    const fileStream = fileSystem.createReadStream('out.txt');
    const rl = readline.createInterface({
        input: fileStream,
        crlfDelay: Infinity
    });

    rl.on('line', function (line) {
        console.log('Line from file:', line);
    });
